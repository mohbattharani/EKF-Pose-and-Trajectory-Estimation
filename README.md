# Pose and Trajectory Estimation Using Extended Kalman Filter

Indoor localization is one major challenges in mobile robots. The aim of this project is to generate a trajectory covered by ardrone Parrot quad-rotor flying in indoor environments. The task is achieved by the estimation of the position and motion of the vehicle by fusing inertial and visual odometery using extended Kalman filter. The approach is widely used in robot trajectory tracking. The data from ARdrone is read through ROS messages over Wi-Fi and then processes on person computer in ROS C++ environment. The travesed trajectory is visualized in RViz tool.
